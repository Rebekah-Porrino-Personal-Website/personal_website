            <h2>HR to Data: Summary of a Journey</h2>
            <p>I started my working career in HR, and continued to grow and expand in that area for over 10 years. 
                My interest has always been in analytics, and I brought this interest into every position I stepped into.  
                Then, about 2 years ago, I decided to move out of a comfortable career, and delve into Data – for realsies.  
                I took a Data Analyst job with Amazon and started tackling all sorts of interesting challenges. 
                Here are a few of the skills I've started to develop:
            </p>
            <li>Database set-up and administration</li>
            <li>Data Engineering</li>
            <li>SQL (I love SQL... it's brilliant)</li>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Data Analytics and Visualization</li>
            <p>It’s been a rewarding and enlightening few years, and I am excited to continue down this new path.</p>

            <h2>Gardening: How does that fit in?</h2>
            <p>There is so much to learn from growing a garden. The first year, you maybe get a radish. The next year, maybe some peas.  
                You keep going like this, tweaking, re-working, re-learning, and eventually you will have a flourishing garden.  
                Gardening is not something you can read all about and suddenly know exactly how to get enough produce to feed a family of 4.  
                Gardening requires learning from experience, because the soil might be different, or the pests in your area.  
                That's the interesting part, you have to know your land.  The amount of rainfall you get, and if that's enough. 
                 How to tell when it's enough... the list goes on.  The point really is just to start thinking differently, 
                 and then applying that new found cognitive ability to other aspects of life.  It's challenging, 
                 it requires patience, and requires diligence.  I love gardening, not because I'm 
                good at it, because there seems to be no limit to it's lessons.
