        <h2>Approach life with curiosity, and you will never be board.</h2>
        <p>Creativity blossoms when you make due with what's available.  I love creating,
            gardening and generally just making things work, with whatever materials I have. 
            This type of creative approach has allowed me to see obsticles as challenges, 
            loss as opportunity, and struggles as times for humble learning. Life is a gift
            and I plan to enjoy it.
